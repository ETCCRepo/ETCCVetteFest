# over FTPS. Run `node build.js` first so App/ETCCVetteFest.html is current —
# this script uploads that file as app-bundle.html, the template index.php
# stitches live data into on every request. To refresh DATA (a new pair of
# ClubExpress CSV exports) without a code change, use Developer > Import
# Registrations in the app, or deploy/upload-registrations.js — see README.md.
# This script never touches anything under data/, which lives only on the

# Credentials: either set FTP_HOST/FTP_USER/FTP_PASS as env vars, or create
# deploy/.ftp-credentials (gitignored — copy .ftp-credentials.example and
# fill in the real password) and this script reads them from there instead —
# same pattern as ../BusinessWebExpress/.ftp-credentials. Env vars, if set,
# take precedence over the file.
#
# The account's FTP home directory is expected to already be the target
# folder (e.g. public_html/vettefest) — check hPanel > Files > FTP Accounts >
# Directory if unsure. FTPS on Hostinger has historically failed hostname
# certificate validation for custom FTP hostnames (SEC_E_WRONG_PRINCIPAL) —
# this script uses -k to skip verification; the channel is still encrypted,
# just not identity-checked. Only run this against a host/account you trust.

# FTPS over Windows' schannel TLS stack has a history of dropping mid-transfer
# on this host (see the file header comment) — manifesting as curl exit 28
# (timeout), 55 (connection reset), or a server-side 550 (exit 25). The 550
# case has a specific known cause here: the server (ProFTPd) uses
# "HiddenStores" — it writes an upload to ".in.<filename>." first and only
# renames it to the real filename on success. If a transfer gets dropped
# mid-upload, that hidden temp file is left behind and blocks every further
# attempt to upload the same filename with a 550. On a 550 we delete ONLY
# that hidden temp file (never the real target — deleting the live file
# would leave the site broken if a retry then also failed) before retrying.

# secrets.php is deliberately NEVER uploaded here (unlike earlier versions of this
# script) — reset-password.php now rewrites the LIVE copy directly when someone
# uses the "Forgot password?" flow. If this script kept uploading the local copy
# on every ordinary code deploy, it would silently overwrite (revert) any password
# changed that way with whatever stale hash happens to be sitting in the local
# repo. To push a manually-generated hash (openssl passwd, see README.md) instead
# of using the reset flow, upload it by hand:
#   curl -sS --netrc-file "$NETRC" --ftp-ssl -k --ftp-pasv -T deploy/secrets.php "$BASE/secrets.php"

# server-accumulated data with no meaningful local copy to overwrite them
# with. See registrations-import.php (the browser CSV upload),
# upload-registrations.js (the CLI equivalent) and Developer > Settings for
# how each of those actually gets refreshed.
